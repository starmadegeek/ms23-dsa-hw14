# CompSci 351 / CompSt 751 Homework Assignment 14

This is a homework assignment at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

## Planning: Due Friday 10pm

### Focus

What is this homework assignment about?
This homework is about understanding how priority queues work and their implementation. Also, about the various strategies of implementing it and using efficient algorithmic techniques like binary search to use and design and efficient strategy.

### Gather

What do I know?  What do I need to know that's new?
I know how to use binary search but need to learn how to use it in a novel setting and adapt to use to for a specific use case. I also know the basics of a priority queue but limited knowledge about circular dynamic arrays and their usage in queue implementations.

### Brainstorm

What are some ideas for solving this homework assignment?
The key idea is to design an approach to find the near end and figure out the wrapping logic of indices in a circular order. Making of diagrams and looking at it on paper helps to understand this and approach at an efficient solution with minimum effort.

What are existing strengths I can bring to bear to solve the problems?
My ability to picture the problem and look at different cases outside code before implementation on paper is a good skill to have and it can help me to solve the problems.

What are some new skills I will need to develop?
I need to develop faster methods and plans to test multiple ideas and work out the best ones as this homework is more vague on exact implementation than previous homeworks.

### Evaluate

What is the best way forward that I can see now?
The best way is to first learn and gather knowledge on circular dynamic arrays and how can they be used to implement a queue with spaces. Then I can look at adapting it to work as a priority queue.

### Plan

What will I work on first after I finish this planning part?
I will work on learning how the circular dynamic arrays work and how to implement binary search on them.

*The preceding steps should be completed and committed by the
Friday 10pm deadline.*

## Reflection: Due Monday 10pm

### Review

Did I correctly anticipate the difficulties?
Yes,
I did correctly anticipate the difficulties with the offer method and the implementation of binary search
which satisfies the equivalent element order rule.

How did the plan go?
The plan went smoothly
as I have kept in mind the later challenges I might face in efficieny tests
and implemented the solutions keeping that in mind which made it easier.

### Preview

What should I do differently for next week's homework assignment?
There is no next week homework as per my understanding.
However, I think I executed the plan and achieved success in a satisfactory way.

Do I need more resources?
I think more clarification on resizing strategy of the array 
and the different cases of offer method like in adding a null element were not clear in the homework document.
